This was a university Project. It is a shop made using Python and Flask. It has most of the functionality but misses a few things.

To run this, you will need to install flask and flaskwtf into your python libraries.

You can simply write into command prompt:

pip install flask
pip install flask_wtf

and then if you load up app.py into visual studio code. You can type flask run. This will allow you to run the shop.
